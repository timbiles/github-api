# GitHub Coding Challenge

### What
This site is a GitHub repo search application, using the GitHub REST API. A user has the ability to search through all repositories from any github user (provided they search the correct username), and can also search for a specific repo by name for each user.

### Setup
To setup, simply clone this repository, and then run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install all dependencies.

### Technologies
For this project I used Javascript, React & React hooks, Redux, styled-components, react-router, and the GitHub API.
